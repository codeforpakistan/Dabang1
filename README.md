# Dabang1
More then half our population don't trust our relative police departments all over Pakistan, our aim is to restore the faith in police and law enforcement departments once for all. Only way we could do that is with the help of our Law enforcement officers and we being innovative developer are here to do our part, we will provide the police departments a tool so they can do their jobs more better and in an easy way.

KP police and Punjab police already have online FIR system that helps them register and track an FIR. what we are offering is way more than that, our system will cover the complete life cycle of a complaint from reporting to resolution of the case resulting in feedback and reviews for the officers and department to motivate and appreciate them to work more efficiently.

How we did it, we are a team of innovative developers so all it took was the right push and we got an idea from our tragic encounter with Punjab police and we decided that something needs to be done about it and here we are.
